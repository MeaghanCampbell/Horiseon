# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is the first challenge assignment for Vanderbilt Coding Boot Camp. The task was to take existing code and improve it without changing what it does. The website was built for a marketing company we and needed to make it more accessible with better SEO.

# INSTRUCTIONS FROM CLIENT:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
Optimize website for search engines

# What I did:
- Consolidated CSS so there was no redundant code
- Added note tags to HTML and CSS
- Formatted HTML semantic elements so each section had the correct spacing, tabbing and indentifiable elements
    - Changed the div element in the header to a nav element
    - Changed div in main content to main
    - Changed div in footer to footer
    - Changed div in sidebar to aside
    - Changed div below main content to section\
- Gave all images alt attributes
- Updated the title element from "website" to "Horiseon Marketing"
- Gave the search-engine-optimization section an ID so it could be linked to the navigation
- changed the div element from class footer to element footer

# This project was built with HTML & CSS
